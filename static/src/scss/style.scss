//  ============== State ==============
//  State rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will
//  look when in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active
//  or inactive? They are about describing how a module or layout
//  looks on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing
//  how a module might look in different views like the home
//  page or the inside page
